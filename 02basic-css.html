  <h2> My favorite color is purple. <h2>
  <p class="purple-text"> You can find purple in a variety of things. Purple has been associated with royalty back then because of the rarity of the ingredients used to make the color. </p>
  <p style="color:black"> It can be fancy or pure, that's why I like purple! </p>
