    <h1>How to sleep better</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Turn off lights at least an hour before you go to bed.</li>
      <li>Don't look at your electronics in bed! Phones have blue light, which disrupts the sleep cycle. </li>
      <li> Get at least 7.5 to 8 hours a day (it depends based on your age).</li>
      <li> Make your sleeping environment cold, homely, and silent.</li>
    </ol>
